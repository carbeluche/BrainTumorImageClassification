Digital Image Processing Final Project 2024
-------------------------------------------

This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical 
imaging, specifically focusing on brain tumor detection. Highlighting the historical
evolution of medical imaging and current challenges, the work emphasizes the 
significance of AI-driven solutions. The model architecture, leveraging 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced techniques like dropout, is
detailed for optimal brain tumor identification. Evaluation metrics, 
including accuracy and loss functions, demonstrate robust performance, with the
development of a user-friendly web application streamlining the detection process.
